# Creating Plugins

Packager supports adding custom plugins in a form of [hooks](#hooks) that get fired in a sequential order.

## Simplest plugin

Creating a plugin is super simple. Let's take a look at the simplest plugin that you can write.

```ts
const tinyPlugin = {
    name: "tiny-plugin"
};
```

That's it, seriously. It does absolutely nothing for us though so let's build something more complex and usable.
But first, you may be wondering why we need the `name` property? Well, there is only 1 required property when creating a plugin and that's (you guessed it) `name`. Trying to register a plugin without it will throw an error.

There are of course other properties (and hooks) that you may add to your plugin to give it some super powers.

## A slightly more usable plugin

Ok, let's build something more usable. How about a little CSS plugin that will inject CSS into the head tag of our application?

We first need to give our plugin a name.

```ts
const cssPlugin = {
    name: "css-plugin"
};
```

Now let's handle file resolution within our plugin by adding a resolver.

```ts
import { resolve, dirname } from "./path-utils";
import { PluginResolverResult } from "packager";

const cssPlugin = {
    name: "css-plugin",
    resolver(moduleId: string, parentId?: string): PluginResolverResult {
        if (!parentId) {
            // This will be the entry file
            return moduleId;
        }

        const file = this.files.find(
            f =>
                f.path === resolve(dirname(parentId), moduleId) &&
                f.path.endsWith(".css")
        );

        if (file) return file.path;

        return null;
    }
};
```

Once the file has been resolved, we'll need tell our plugin how to load it.

```ts
import { resolve, dirname } from "./path-utils";
import { PluginResolverResult, PluginLoaderResult } from "packager";

const cssPlugin = {
    name: "css-plugin",
    resolver(moduleId: string, parentId?: string): PluginResolverResult {
        if (!parentId) {
            // This will be the entry file
            return moduleId;
        }

        const file = this.files.find(
            f =>
                f.path === resolve(dirname(parentId), moduleId) &&
                f.path.endsWith(".css")
        );

        if (file) {
            return file.path;
        }

        return null;
    },
    loader(moduleId: string): PluginLoaderResult {
        const file = this.files.find(
            f => f.path === moduleId && f.path.endsWith(".css")
        );

        if (file) {
            return {
                code: file.code
            };
        }

        return null;
    }
};
```

There's one last step we need to do. Packager _treats every file as a JS file_ so to get CSS files, you have to "export" them as JS files and in order to do that, we can do something like this:

```ts
// utils.ts

export const addCssExport = (code: string) =>
    `export default ` +
    `function addStyles () {` +
    `const tag = document.createElement('style');` +
    `tag.type = 'text/css';` +
    `tag.appendChild(document.createTextNode(\`${code}\`));` +
    `document.head.appendChild(tag);` +
    `} addStyles();`;

export const isCss = (filePath) => filePath.endsWith('.css');
```

So let's tie everything together and give this a go :)

```ts
import { PluginResolverResult, PluginLoaderResult, PluginBeforeBundleResult } from "packager";
import { resolve, dirname } from "./path-utils";
import { addCssExport, isCss } from "./utils";

const cssPlugin = {
    name: "css-plugin",
    resolver(moduleId: string, parentId?: string): PluginResolverResult {
        if (!parentId) {
            // This will be the entry file
            return moduleId;
        }

        const file = this.files.find(
            f =>
                f.path === resolve(dirname(parentId), moduleId) &&
                isCss(f.path)
        );

        if (file) {
            return file.path;
        }

        return null;
    },
    loader(moduleId: string): PluginLoaderResult {
        const file = this.files.find(
            f => f.path === moduleId && isCss(f.path)
        );

        if (file) {
            return {
                code: file.code
            };
        }

        return null;
    },
    beforeBundle(code: string, moduleId: string): PluginBeforeBundleResult {
        if (isCss(moduleId)) {
            return addCssExport(code);
        }

        return null;
    }
};
```

Congratulations - you have created a pretty useful plugin so now let's register this sexy looking thing! :)

## Bundle up your plugin

TBC.

Bundling a plugin together to be used in Packager. Maybe explore a CLI here to make it even easier to create plugins.

## Registering your plugin

Registering a plugin is super easy. If you have instantiated your plugin, you can do this:

```ts
const packager = new Packager();

const myPlugin = {
    //...
};

packager.registerPlugin(myPlugin);
```

It's important to keep in mind the order that we register plugins in. If you have created a plugin that is a "catch all" for all files in a resolver, it makes sense to register that plugin last because since we are catching all files, all other plugin resolves will never be called.

Check out the API reference for some additional information about properties and hooks.

## API Reference

### Properties

#### name

This property is used primarily for displaying more descriptive error messages and internally, to keep track of transpilers and a few other things that you'll learn below 👇

<ApiProps type="string" required="true" />

```ts usage=true
const amazingPlugin = {
    name: "amazing-plugin"
    // ...
};
```

#### transpiler

A Transpiler is responsible for transpiling code and is arguably the most important part in a plugin. At its core, every transpiler has a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) to offload the transpilation process from the UI thread.  
Head over to [Worker Transpilers](/plugins/worker-transpilers) to see how to create one.

<ApiProps type="PluginTranspiler" required="false" />

```ts usage=true
import { createTranspiler } from 'packager';
import Worker from 'web-worker:./my-worker.ts';

const myTranspiler = createTranspiler({
    worker: Worker
});

const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    transpiler: myTranspiler
    // ...
};
```

<Note>It is recommended to create a Transpiler using a helper that Packager provides.</Note>

#### extensions

Extensions are required when we use a transpiler. This is because the plugin that we may create, may be used by other plugins and Packager uses extensions to determine which transpiler to load.

As an example, a SASS/SCSS plugin has ".sass" and ".scss" extensions. A Vue Plugin which allows the use of SASS/SCSS code will need to load the SASS/SCSS Plugin. Packager will do that for us as long as the extensions match.

<ApiProps type="string[]" required="false" />

```ts usage=true
const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    extensions: ['.sass', '.scss']
    // ...
};
```

<Note>Extensions are required if we are using a transpiler.</Note>

### Hooks

There are 3 hooks that your plugin can use - `resolver`, `loader` and `beforeBundle`.

#### resolver

Resolvers are your plugin's entry point and are used to verify whether a file (or package) that is being imported actually exists. It's quite possible that you'll never need to use this hook because Packager comes with very powerful resolvers capable of resolving even NPM dependencies but of course, you'll need to first include them first.

Every resolver should resolve a full path to the file so that it's easier to retrieve a particular in the `loader` hook.

Returning `null` will defer to the next resolver function in line and if there isn't one, it will ignore this file and you will most likely get an error because the imported file/package won't be resolved.

For more information, see [Rollup's docs for resolvers](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#hooks).

<ApiProps
    type="(moduleId: string, parentId: string | undefined) => string | null | void | { id: string, syntheticNamedExports?: boolean | null }"
    required="false"
/>

```ts usage=true
import { PluginResolverResult } from "packager";
import { resolve, dirname } from "./path-utils";

const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    resolver(moduleId: string, parentId?: string): PluginResolverResult {
        if (!parentId) {
            // This will be the entry file
            return moduleId;
        }

        const file = this.files.find(
            f => f.path === resolve(dirname(parentId), moduleId)
        );

        if (file) {
            return file.path;
        }

        return null;
    }
    // ...
};
```

#### loader

Once a file has been resolved, we can load that particular file from anywhere we want. It can be the built-in FS on `this.files` or you could fetch a file from a CDN like [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) or [JSDELIVR](https://www.jsdelivr.com).

For more information, see [Rollup's docs for loaders](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#hooks).

<ApiProps
    type="(moduleId: string) => string | null | void | { id: string, map?: string | SourceMap, syntheticNamedExports?: boolean | null }"
    required="false"
/>

```ts usage=true
import { PluginLoaderResult } from "packager";

const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    loader(moduleId: string): PluginLoaderResult {
        const file = this.files.find(f => f.path === moduleId);

        if (file) {
            return {
                code: file.code
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
    // ...
};
```

#### beforeBundle

This hook fires right before Packager is done bundling the code. It's useful if you want to add a piece of code in the final bundle.

If your plugin has a `transpiler`, the code that is fed into this hook is what comes out of the transpiler.

<ApiProps type="(code: string) => string | void" required="false" />

```ts usage=true
import { PluginBeforeBundleResult } from "packager";

const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    beforeBundle(code: string): PluginBeforeBundleResult {
        return `function wrapCode () {
            ${code}
        }`;
    }
};
```
