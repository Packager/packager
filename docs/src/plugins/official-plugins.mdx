# Official Plugins

Packager comes with a few official plugins which you can easily register to your Packager instance.

It is worth noting that at the moment, none of the plugins support options/custom configs. This is something that could be explored in the future if there is enough demand.

All of the plugins can be used in the browser environment as well as node.

### CoffeeScript

Adds support for CoffeeScript files.

You can start using it from a CDN ([UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/packager-plugin-coffeescript), [JSDELIVR](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/packager-plugin-coffeescript)) or NPM:

```bash
yarn add packager-plugin-coffeescript
